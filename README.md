# Meme Me V1 and V2 for Udacity
Meme V1 I did while completing IOS Dev program at Udacity
Project Overview
I created an app that enables a user to take a picture, and add text at the top and bottom to form a meme, and share that meme on Facebook and Twitter and also by SMS or email. In this project, sent memes will appear in a tab view with two tabs: a table view and a collection view.

Why this project?
MemeMe covers many of the major UI components found in essentially every app. It combines them with the camera and social media activity view to create a fun and personal user experience.

This project will display I am able to-
Set up a navigation structure that creates an intuitive flow through the app
Build tables with datasources and delegates
Create custom table view cells
Implement user interfaces with tab views and collection views
Why is this project meaningful to my career?
Becoming comfortable using all of the key components of UIKit is an essential step in becoming an iOS developer.
Understanding UIKit allows a developer to make educated assumptions about the architecture of apps that they use.
Mastering UKit fundamentals frees a developer up to learn model-oriented skills like networking and persistence.
